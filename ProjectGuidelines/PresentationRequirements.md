# Presentation Requirements

The presentation requirements for Project 1 are as follows.

Your presentation must:

- [ ] Be at least 8-10 min. long

- [ ] Describe the core message or hypothesis for your project.

- [ ] Describe the questions you and your group found interesting, and what motivated you to answer them

- [ ] Summarize where and how you found the data you used to answer these questions

- [ ] Describe the data exploration and cleanup process (accompanied by your Jupyter Notebook)

- [ ] Describe the analysis process (accompanied by your Jupyter Notebook)

- [ ] Summarize your conclusions. This should include a numerical summary (i.e., what data did your analysis yield), as well as visualizations of that summary (plots of the final analysis data)

- [ ] Discuss the implications of your findings. This is where you get to have an open-ended discussion about what your findings "mean".

- [ ] Tell a good story! Storytelling through data analysis is no different than in literature. Find your narrative and use your analysis and visualization skills to highlight conflict and resolution in your data.
